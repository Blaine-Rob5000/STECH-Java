/*

(The Person , Student , Employee , Faculty , and Staff classes) Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee . Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee .
		A person has a name, address, phone number, and email address.
		A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant.
		An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined in Programming Exercise 10.14 to create an object for date hired.
		A faculty member has office hours and a rank.
		A staff member has a title.
		
		Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.

Write a test program that creates a Person , Student , Employee , Faculty , and Staff , and invokes their toString()methods.
